Prior Job Experiences: <p/>
<p style="font-family: 'times new roman', serif; color: IndianRed; font-size: 25px">
Babysitting: Because I have a little sister, I'm quite used to watching and being around kids. Previously, I have babysat for a family with 3 kids (2 boys and a girl) and I have also done smaller groups as well. I have taken multiple first aid classes and I am becoming CPR certified this Fall. <p/>

Odd Jobs: I've done quite a few odd jobs before. My mom is an avid gardener, so I'd like to say that I also have a bit of a green thumb. I (surprisingly, I know) enjoy weeding and would like to say that I'm pretty darn good at it. I volunteer often at Joppa Hill Farm and I have also had people hire me for weeding their gardens in the past. Additionally, I have a passion for organizing and cleaning and I would love to help you out with anything within your home. Whether it's moving boxes or cleaning out the attic, I'd be able to do it. <p/>
<p style="font-family: 'times new roman', serif; color: IndianRed; font-size: 25px">
I look forward to helping out you and your family! <p/>
