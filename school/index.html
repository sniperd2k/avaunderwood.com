<p style="font-family: 'Bookman Header'; color:DarkCyan; font-size: 20px;">Starting in my Freshman year of high school, I 
was able to achieve receiving all A's and ended with a 4.0 GPA. It was a fantastic year for me because I also ran on the
Bedford Cross Country team and the Bedford Indoor Track team. I was planning on doing Bedford Outdoor Track as well, but
sadly it was cancelled by our quarantine. Here are a few images from both seasons.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Bookman Header'; color:DarkCyan; font-size: 20px;">My best race from the year occurred at Coe-Brown Northwood Academy.
I was running the JV race and out of 179 girls, I was successful in placing ninth. Sadly, after that race, I caught a cold and 
had a difficult rest of the season. After cross country, I joined the indoor track team for the winter season. This was my first year
of doing indoor track ever (it was not offered at our junior high), so I bounced in between doing different races, and finally decided
on the 600 meter. Although I was definitely not as fast as some of the upperclassmen, I cut my time down from 2:03 to 1:58 after only
racing the 600 meter twice. I had planned on joining the outdoor track team for the spring, but sadly the season was cancelled due to
COVID-19. I had planned on running the 800 meter, my race from junior high.
