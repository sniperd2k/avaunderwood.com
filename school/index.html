Ava Underwood: Class of 2023

Starting in my Freshman year at Bedford High School, I took all Honors classes and made it my goal to do well in school. I ended the year with a 4.39 GPA and a completed goal. It was a fantastic year for me because I also ran on the cross 
country team and the indoor track team. I was planning on doing outdoor track as well, but sadly it was cancelled due to quarantine. Here are a few images from both seasons.

My best race from the year occurred during cross country at Coe-Brown Northwood Academy. I was able to place ninth out of 179 girls and that only made me want to get even better. After cross country, I joined the indoor track team for 
the winter season. I decided to race the 600 meter and I cut my time down from 2:03 to 1:58 after only racing it twice. During my Freshman year I fell in love with running and I look forward to running for 9 more seasons during the rest of 
my high school career. Along with classes and sports, I am a member of Key club which is an international, student-led organization that is dedicated to volunteering and creating leaders. I also am a part of Spanish club and I love to learn about new and different cultures.
Additionally, I enjoy coding and web design.
