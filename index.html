<p style="font-family: 'Bookman Header'; color:DarkCyan; font-size: 20px;">Starting in my Freshman year of high school, I 
was able to achieve receiving all A's and ended with a 4.0 GPA. It was a fantastic year for me because I also ran on the
Bedford Cross Country team and the Bedford Indoor Track team. I was planning on doing Bedford Outdoor Track as well, but
sadly it was cancelled by our quarantine. Here are a few images from both seasons.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Bookman Header'; color:DarkCyan; font-size: 20px;">My best race from the year occurred at Coe-Brown Northwood Academy.
I was running the JV race and out of 179 girls, I was successful in placing ninth. Sadly, after that wonderful race, I caught a cold and 
had a difficult rest of the season.
