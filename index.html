<p style="font-family: 'Bookman Header'; color:DarkCyan; font-size: 20px;">Starting in my Freshman year of high school, I 
was able to achieve receiving all A's and ended with a 4.0 GPA. It was a fantastic year for me because I also ran on the
Bedford Cross Country team and the Bedford Indoor Track team. I was planning on doing Bedford Outdoor Track as well, but
sadly it was cancelled by our quarantine.

Many girls got season's bests and the team was able to walk out with a beautiful plaque. brick
