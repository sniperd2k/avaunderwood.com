<p style="font-family: 'Bookman Header'; color:DarkCyan; font-size: 20px;">Starting in my Freshman year of high school, I 
was able to achieve receiving all A's and ended with a 4.0 GPA. It was a fantastic year for me because I also ran on the
Bedford Cross Country team and the Bedford Indoor Track team. I was planning on doing Bedford Outdoor Track as well, but
sadly it was cancelled by our quarantine. Here are a few images from both seasons.</p>

Many girls got season's bests and the team was able to walk out with a beautiful plaque. brick
