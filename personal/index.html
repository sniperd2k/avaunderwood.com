Hi! I'm Ava.
<p style="font-family: 'times new roman', serif; color: IndianRed; font-size: 25px">
I'm a 14 year old girl from Bedford, NH and I live with my parents and my crazy 11 year old sister, Emme. I love
spending time outdoors and I am an avid runner. I am also planning on joining the Pat's Peak Ski Patrol Team during the Fall
of 2020. I ski and snowboard as much as possible, and I run year-round. Additionally, I am a member of MENSA and I
love anything and everything that has to do with STEM. After high school, my goals are to make it to WPI or MIT to
follow my dream of becoming a web designer or programmer and to also perfect speaking Swedish, which at the moment,
I am not fantastic at. Also, I love spending time at the beach with my family. <p/>

Prior Job Experiences: <p/>
<p style="font-family: 'times new roman', serif; color: IndianRed; font-size: 25px">
Babysitting: Because I have a little sister, I'm quite used to watching and being around kids. Previously, I have babysat for a family with 3 kids (2 boys and a girl) and I have also done smaller groups as well. I have taken multiple first aid classes and I am becoming CPR certified this Fall. <p/>
<p style="font-family: 'times new roman', serif; color: IndianRed; font-size: 25px">
Odd Jobs: Previously, I've done quite a few odd jobs. My mom is an avid gardener, so I'd like to say that I also have a bit of a green thumb. I (surprisingly, I know) enjoy weeding and would like to say that I'm pretty darn good at it. I volunteer often at Joppa Hill Farm and I have also had weeding jobs in the past. Additionally, I really have a passion for organizing and cleaning and I would love to help you out with anything within your home. Whether it's moving boxes or cleaning out the attic, I'd be able to do it. <p/>
