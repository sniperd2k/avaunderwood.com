Hi! I'm Ava.
<p style="font-family: 'times new roman', serif; color: IndianRed; font-size: 30px">
I'm a 14 year old girl from Bedford, NH and I live with my parents and my crazy 11 year old sister, Emme. I love
spending time outdoors and I am an avid runner and I am also joining the Pat's Peak Ski Patrol Team during the Fall
of 2020. I ski and snowboard as much as possible, and I run year-round. Additionally, I am a member of MENSA and I
love anything and everything that has to do with STEM. After high school, my goals are to make it to WPI or MIT to
follow my dream of becoming a web designer or programmer and to also perfect my Swedish, which at the moment is not
so perfect.
